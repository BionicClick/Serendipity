# Serendipity - a PHP Weblog/Blog software

[Serendipity](http://s9y.org) is a PHP-powered weblog application which gives the user an easy way to maintain an online diary, weblog or even a complete homepage. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers a flexible, expandable and easy-to-use framework with the power for professional applications.

This is a testing branch to mainly support the new backend smartification.

Use with care!
